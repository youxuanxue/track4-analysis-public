Track 4 Faithfulness Judge — Explainability
=====================================================================
Wires DeBERTa-v3-based NLI models to the QFBench2 EnsembleNLIJudge protocol
for citation-faithfulness scoring.

In Track 4, agents predict a target (label or numeric value) per row in a table of
entities, grounded in a frozen evidence corpus. Each claim in the submission must be
entailed by the cited corpus passage. This judge checks that entailment relationship.

Models (Laurer et al., 2024):
  - cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-large  (HuggingFace)
  - MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli  (HuggingFace)

These models are run from locally cached weights only: the scoring environment
has no route to the HuggingFace hub (the eval network is restricted — egress is
limited to the audited model-API proxy and the organizer-hosted model endpoint;
hub domains are not on the allowlist).
Cache path: /model-cache/ (pre-staged in the evaluation Docker image).

NLI direction convention
------------------------
The *premise* is the cited passage from the corpus; the *hypothesis* is the
claim made by the participant's answer.  A high entailment score means the
passage genuinely supports the claim.  Contradiction or neutral means the
claim goes beyond (or contradicts) what the passage says.

    entailment  →  faithful (score → 1.0)
    neutral     →  neither supported nor refuted (score depends on model)
    contradiction → unfaithful (score → 0.0)

The returned float is the model's softmax probability for the "entailment"
class, averaged across all models in the ensemble.

@dataclass
class DeBERTaNLIJudge:
    """Single-model NLI judge backed by a DeBERTa-v3-large HuggingFace pipeline.

    Implements the :class:`NLIJudge` protocol (``score(premise, hypothesis) ->
    float``) so it can be used standalone or composed into an
    :class:`EnsembleNLIJudge`.

    The underlying HuggingFace pipeline is loaded **lazily** on the first call
    to :meth:`score`.  This avoids paying the GPU/CPU warmup cost for judge
    objects that are never actually used (e.g. in unit tests that mock the
    score method).

    NLI direction
    -------------
    The cited passage is the *premise* (``sequences``) and the claim is the sole
    *candidate label*, with ``hypothesis_template="{}"`` so the pipeline's
    hypothesis is the claim verbatim and ``multi_label=True`` so the returned
    score is the independent ``P(entailment | premise, claim)``.  Passing
    ``["entailment", "neutral", "contradiction"]`` as the candidate labels would
    classify the premise against those three literal words and ignore the claim.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_id : str
        HuggingFace model repository ID.  Must be one of the DeBERTa-v3 NLI
        models (see :data:`NLI_MODEL_IDS`).
    cache_dir : str
        Local filesystem path where cached model weights are stored.  Defaults
        to :data:`DEFAULT_CACHE_DIR` (``/model-cache``).
    device : int
        Torch device index.  ``-1`` selects CPU (default); ``0`` selects the
        first CUDA GPU.  The default is ``-1`` because it is the portable
        choice, not because no accelerator exists: this docstring used to cite
        ``gpu=false`` in ``card.toml`` as the reason, and both card files in
        this repo in fact declare ``gpu = true``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> judge = DeBERTaNLIJudge("cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-large")
    >>> score = judge.score(
    ...     premise="Apple's Q1 FY2024 Services revenue was $23.1B.",
    ...     hypothesis="Apple Services grew in Q1 FY2024.",

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_ids : list[str] | None
        HuggingFace model IDs to include in the ensemble.  Defaults to
        :data:`NLI_MODEL_IDS` (both DeBERTa-v3-large models).

    device : int

    -------
    EnsembleNLIJudge
        An ensemble judge whose :meth:`score` method returns the mean
        entailment probability across all member models.

) -> float:
    """Score a single claim against its cited passage.

    Convenience wrapper around :meth:`~EnsembleNLIJudge.score` that follows
    the Track 4 NLI direction convention:

    * The **premise** is *cited_span_text* — the verbatim passage from the
      corpus document that the participant cited.
    * The **hypothesis** is *claim_text* — the participant's claim that
      purports to be grounded in that passage.

    A high entailment score (→ 1.0) means the passage genuinely entails the
    claim: the claim is faithful.  A score at or below the per-citation
    threshold ``tau_citation`` (0.5 by default) means the claim overstates or
    misrepresents the passage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    claim_text : str
        The participant's claim, taken verbatim from
        ``answer["claims"][i]["text"]``.
    cited_span_text : str
        The resolved text of the cited corpus span (resolved from
        ``citation["doc_id"]`` + ``citation["span"]`` in the answer JSON).
    judge : NLIJudge | None
        A pre-built judge (e.g. :class:`DeBERTaNLIJudge` or
        :class:`EnsembleNLIJudge`).  If ``None``, :func:`build_ensemble_judge`
        is called with default arguments to construct a fresh ensemble.
        Passing an already-constructed judge is preferred in batch contexts
        to avoid repeated model initialisation.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        P(entailment) in [0.0, 1.0].  Values above 0.5 (``tau_citation``) count
        the claim as supported; the Track 4 admissibility gate then requires at
        least 80% of claims to be supported (``faithfulness_threshold``).

    Raises
    ------

    parts, so there is no second implementation of the gate to drift:

    1. ``align_predictions`` against the **trusted roster**, which fixes the denominator. The
       previous local check counted ``_collect_claims(answer)``: padding one entity with seven

    3. ``prediction_claims(aligned, ctx["_hypothesis_spec"])``: the hypothesis handed to the judge
       is the **canonical prediction sentence** built from the submitted label / point forecast /
       rank / interval plus the trusted task schema. It is never ``claim["text"]``. That rule was

       ``[-100, -98]`` whose prose accurately described a real corpus passage scored
       **faithfulness 1.0 / gate_pass True** locally while the real gate scored **0.0**. A
       pre-check that is wrong in that direction is worse than no pre-check.
    4. ``qfbench2_common.scoring.faithfulness.citation_faithfulness`` for the aggregate — the same
       shared primitive the gate calls, given the same claim list and the same trusted lookup.

    Raises :class:`~qfbench2_track_analysis.codes.T4ParticipantFailure` for anything the gate
