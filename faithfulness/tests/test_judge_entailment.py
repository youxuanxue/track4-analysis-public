"""Regression tests for :meth:`DeBERTaNLIJudge.entail`.

These pin the NLI call convention rather than model behaviour, so they need no
weights and no network.  They exist because the judge previously passed
``candidate_labels=["entailment", "neutral", "contradiction"]``, which classifies
the premise against those three literal words and never uses the claim -- making
every claim against a given premise score identically and rendering the
citation-faithfulness component of the composite inert.
