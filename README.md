# Track 4 — Explainability (Public Starter Kit)

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 4 asks: can an AI predict a label or value for each row in a table — for example, whether a
company will beat its earnings forecast — **and prove it used real documents to do so?** Every
submission receives a table of entities (companies, securities, events), each with a mix of numeric
and categorical features. The AI must predict a **target** per row (a class label for
classification tasks, a numeric estimate for regression, or a ranked order across rows for
ranking tasks), return a 90% confidence interval, and supply **citations** to passages in a frozen
evidence corpus that ground each claim. If the citations do not hold up under an NLI (natural
language inference) check — the automated system decides whether the cited passage actually
supports the claim — the submission is ineligible regardless of how accurate its predictions were.

This folder is the **public starter kit** — everything you need to build, test, and submit a
Track 4 agent. The hidden test questions and their ground-truth outcomes live in a private
repository that only organisers can see. **No answers are in this folder.**

New to the track? Read `docs/CONCEPTS.md` first — it defines every term used in Track 4 — then
this file, then work the exemplar unit and the ten practice units under `units/`. For the shape of
a unit on disk and which of its fields the scorer actually reads, see `docs/AUTHORING-GUIDE.md`;
for the prediction families published here, `docs/CATEGORIES.md`. (The competition-wide GLOSSARY
spanning all four tracks is published with the shared toolkit: `Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public`,
file `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — the same public repository this track installs `qfbench2-common` from.
`docs/CONCEPTS.md` stays the definitive reference for this track.)

## What Track 4 is — and what it is not

Track 4 is about **general tabular prediction** grounded in text evidence. Each task gives you:

- A **table** where every row is an entity (a company, a security, an event) and every column is
  a feature — some numeric (revenue, market cap, spread), some categorical (sector, rating), some
  text (management commentary excerpts).
- A **target column** to predict per row: a class label (e.g., `beat`/`miss`/`inline`), a numeric
  value (e.g., a probability score), or a ranking across the rows.
- A **frozen evidence corpus** of SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) and macroeconomic releases (FRED
  data), all dated on or before a `cutoff_date`.

Track 4 is **not** time-series forecasting. It does not ask you to predict the next value in a
sequential series. It asks you to predict a target for a cross-section of entities, using tabular
features plus evidence-grounded reasoning.

| Track 2 | Track 4 |
|---------|---------|
| Data: time series (observations over time for one or a few series) | Data: general tabular (rows = entities; columns = heterogeneous features) |
| Task: forecast the next value in a series | Task: predict a target per row / entity |
| Models to beat: time-series foundation models | Models to beat: tabular foundation models (TabPFN, XGBoost/LightGBM) |
| Both tracks: add text + agentic reasoning; run closed-resource (Docker, restricted network — model APIs via audited proxy only, no open internet); leakage-controlled |

## What this repository contains

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `docs/CONCEPTS.md` | Plain-English explainer for every concept (tabular prediction, NLI, calibration, etc.) |
| `docs/CATEGORIES.md` | The prediction families published here, read off the shipped units |
| `docs/AUTHORING-GUIDE.md` | How a unit is laid out, field by field, and who reads each field |
| `units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/` | A complete worked example: task file, cross-section table, corpus, example answer |
| `units/` (ten more) | Practice units — real corpora, real task shapes, no resolved outcomes; not scored |
| `qfbench2_track_analysis/scoring.py` | The reference scorer, for all three target types (`scoring/scoring.py` is a back-compat shim that re-exports it) |
| `faithfulness/judge.py` | The NLI faithfulness judge you can run locally before submitting |
| `baselines/` | A runnable stdlib RAG agent, a BM25 + house-model scaffold, and an optional citation rail |
| `templates/answer.example.json` | The authoritative `answer.json` shape |

> **The published units are format exemplars, not a representative sample.** The held-out set is
> substantially larger and spans many more task families, across all three target types. Most of
> its families have no published counterpart at all, so do not tune to the shapes you can see
> here — and do not treat the eleven published units as a syllabus. What is guaranteed to carry

---

## Submission format

Your submission is a **Docker image** that implements the `analyze` command:

```bash
analyze \
  --task   /input/task.json \
  --corpus /input/corpus \
  --out    /output/answer.json
```

The harness runs your image as `docker run <image> analyze --task … --corpus … --out …`, so
**`analyze` arrives as the first argument, not as part of the image's own configuration.** Your
image must either expose `analyze` as an executable on `PATH` (build with no `ENTRYPOINT`), or —
if you use `ENTRYPOINT ["python", "analyze.py"]` — have `analyze.py` accept `analyze` as a
leading positional argument. An image that ignores the verb exits 2 on every unit before reading
any input. `baselines/baseline_agent/cli.py` shows the second shape; the full contract is
[`SUBMISSION_CLI.md`](SUBMISSION_CLI.md).

### answer.json — what the output must look like

For a **classification** task (e.g., EPS beat/miss/inline):

```json
{
  "task_id":      "t4-2024q2-eps-aapl-001",
  "schema_version": "3",
  "target_type":  "classification",
  "entity_predictions": [
    {
      "entity_id":  "AAPL",
      "label":      "beat",
      "point_forecast": 1.62,
      "interval":   { "level": 0.90, "lo": 1.48, "hi": 1.78 },
      "claims": [
        {
          "doc_id":     "EDGAR_0000320193_10Q_20240202",
          "span_start": 295,
          "span_end":   627,
          "claim":      "Services revenue grew 11% year-over-year in Q1 FY2024, supporting continued margin expansion."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "evidence_trace": "Retrieved 8 documents. Top span: EDGAR_0000320193_10Q_20240202 295-627 (NLI 0.91). No post-cutoff citations. Embargo: PASS."
}
```

> The authoritative shape is `templates/answer.example.json`; validate against
> `analysis.schema.json` rather than against this excerpt.

For a **regression** task (e.g., credit-event probability), `point_forecast` is the primary
prediction; `label` may be omitted or set to a threshold-derived class. For a **ranking** task,
`point_forecast` is *also* the primary prediction — the ordering is taken from it, and `label` is
**not** read. Put the predicted metric value in `point_forecast`; the optional integer `rank`
field records your ordering for readers but does not feed the score, and if you supply it at all
it must be a permutation of 1..n over the full entity roster.

The common mistake, measured: putting the **rank integer** in `point_forecast` (1 = highest)
inverts the ordering against a metric where larger is better, and scores
`predictive_quality = 0.0`, composite `-0.03`, against `1.0` / `0.67` for the metric values
themselves. Omitting `point_forecast` on a ranking unit is refused outright. In every case there is one entry in
`entity_predictions` per entity row.

Required fields for all task types:
- `task_id`: copied from `task.json`; `schema_version`; and `target_type` — set it to the unit's
  card value (`SUBMISSION_CLI.md` invariant 7). A `target_type` that disagrees with the card is
  `t4.target_type_mismatch`, a whole-submission `SCHEMA_INVALID_OUTPUT` at `W = -0.27`; omitting
  the field is accepted and scored, so never copy a literal one out of an example.
- `entity_predictions`: one object per entity row, each with:
  - `entity_id`, and `label` (classification) **or** `point_forecast` (regression **and** ranking);
  - `interval`: the 90% confidence range `{"level": 0.90, "lo": …, "hi": …}` (`level` is pinned);
  - `claims`: one or more citations, each with `doc_id`, `span_start`, `span_end`, `claim`.
- `evidence_trace`: a human-readable summary of the retrieval and reasoning process.

**These are not partial-credit penalties.** A missing `interval.lo` or `interval.hi`, an empty or
absent `claims` array, or an `interval.level` other than the card's — on *any* single entity row —
fails `g1_schema` for the **whole submission**: the unit is scored `t4.schema_invalid`
(`SCHEMA_INVALID_OUTPUT`) at the worst-case `W = -0.27`, and no coverage or faithfulness number is
computed at all. Verified by running the scorer on each case.

### Runtime constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Network | `network = "restricted"` — no open internet. Egress only through the organizer's audited proxy to the organizer-hosted open-model endpoint (`$MODEL_ENDPOINT`, OpenAI-compatible, free within a per-run budget) and **nothing else**; vendor model APIs (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, generativelanguage.googleapis.com, any other) are **refused by the proxy** (policy 2026-08-04), and no participant API keys exist. Every connection is logged (domain, bytes, timestamps). |
| Corpus path | `/input/corpus` is read-only |
| Output | Must write `/output/answer.json` before process exits |
| Exit code | Must exit 0 on success |
| Timeout | 10 minutes per unit, set authoritatively in `card.toml [agent].timeout_sec = 600.0` — exceeding this budget causes a g2 timeout failure |
| Image size | Recommended ≤ 15 GB; over 20 GB may be rejected |

**Why restricted, not open.** The corpus is frozen. The embargo rule forbids fetching documents
or data published after `cutoff_date`. Open internet access at inference time would make the
embargo unenforceable — so the only permitted egress is model-API traffic through the audited
proxy, where every connection is logged and becomes the audit artifact for the verification
phase. Vendor-side tools (web search, code execution, retrieval) **must be disabled** in API
calls; this is enforced by rule and audit. Data/text cutoffs are unchanged and still enforced by
the harness (`g2`).

**Two modes, one contract.**

1. **API mode** (`category = "api"`): your agent calls the organizer-hosted model endpoint
   (`$MODEL_ENDPOINT`); your contribution is the prompts, harness, system prompts, and agents.
   No participant API keys are injected and none exist (policy 2026-08-04) — the house endpoint
   is the only reachable model.
2. **BYO mode** (`category = "byo-large"` for 80GB-class GPU images, `"byo-small"` for ≤~8B
   models on CPU or small GPU): you bundle your own model weights in-image. BYO entries may
   *also* call APIs as in mode 1.

At scoring time the container sees: `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` pointing at the audited proxy,
`MODEL_ENDPOINT` pointing at the organizer-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g.
`http://model:8000/v1`) when available, and `QFBENCH_NETWORK=restricted`. Local smoke runs
without the eval network fall back to `--network=none`, so your agent must degrade gracefully
(still emit a schema-valid `answer.json`) when model APIs are unreachable.

**Reproducibility.** Model versions must be pinned (dated snapshots), the training cutoff of
every model must be disclosed in submission metadata, and temperature/seed pinned where the API
supports it. API-based entries are verified statistically (bootstrap-CI overlap on rerun); BYO
entries bit-reproducibly.

**Budget (PROVISIONAL — not final).** A uniform per-unit model-API budget applies to every
submission (provisional figure: 1,000,000 input + 100,000 output tokens per unit), enforced via
proxy logs and spot audit. This figure has not been finalised, so treat it as a planning number and
not a contract: build so that a change to it does not invalidate your approach. The final figure
will be announced here before any scored run, and `SUBMISSION_CLI.md` carries the same statement.

**Leaderboard.** One board; every entry is tagged with its category, models used (pinned
versions), and training cutoffs.

### Minimal Dockerfile pattern

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim
LABEL qfbench2.interface_version="2.0"   # required on every submission image (gate g0)
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
# The harness appends: analyze --task /input/task.json --corpus /input/corpus/ --out /output/answer.json
# so analyze.py receives "analyze" as argv[1] and must declare it, e.g.
#   parser.add_argument("verb", nargs="?", default="analyze", choices=["analyze"])
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "analyze.py"]
CMD ["analyze", "--help"]
```

See `baselines/Dockerfile` for a working reference. The harness interpreter is **Python 3.13** —
pinned as part of the hardware contract published before the **2026-08-10 compute-caps freeze**, and
a ceiling rather than a floor (`nemoguardrails` and `nvidia-nat` both pin `<3.14`).

## Installing the shared toolkit

Track 4 inherits scoring utilities from the shared toolkit repository. Install them with:

```bash
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.3.1#subdirectory=common"
```

> **Pin a tag, never a branch.** Installing from a moving ref means your local result and your
> scored result can diverge without either being wrong.

This gives you the `HierarchicalVerifier`, `F.citation_faithfulness`, `F.embargo_violations`,
and `F.analysis_composite` functions used by `scoring/scoring.py`.

---

## How the NLI faithfulness smoke check works

Before your submission reaches the official scorer, you can pre-check it locally:

```bash
python faithfulness/judge.py --answer /tmp/my_answer.json --unit units/<unit-id>
```

`--unit` is **required** with `--answer`, and it is the unit *directory* — the one holding
`task.json`, `card.toml`, `manifest.json` and `corpus/` — not the corpus directory alone. All
four are inputs to the gate this is previewing: the roster and the target schema come from
`task.json`, the thresholds from `card.toml`, and a `doc_id` resolves only to a document
`manifest.json` declares. Without them the check would have nothing to score against and would
fail closed.

The check runs the same DeBERTa NLI ensemble (two models, averaged entailment probability) and the
same shared scoring primitives the official scorer uses. Per **roster entity** — not per sentence
you wrote — it:

1. Aligns your `entity_predictions[]` against the unit's entity roster. A missing, duplicated or
   unknown entity fails here, exactly as it fails the gate.
2. Resolves each cited `doc_id` through the unit's manifest and checks its `doc_date` against the
   cutoff. An unresolved, undated or post-cutoff citation is a **violation**, not a shrug.
3. Builds the **canonical hypothesis** for that entity — one sentence derived from the values you
   submitted (`label` / `point_forecast` / `rank` / `interval`) plus the trusted task schema — and
   asks the judge whether a cited span entails *that*.
4. Reports the fraction of roster entities whose prediction is supported (a span entailing above
   `tau_citation`, 0.5).

**The hypothesis is your prediction, never your prose.** Your `claim` text is parsed and shown, but
it is not what the judge is asked about, so accurately describing a passage you cited cannot make a
wrong prediction faithful. Writing more claims cannot help either: the denominator is the roster.

Output example (the exemplar unit, one entity):
```
Scoring 1 prediction(s) from '/tmp/my_answer.json' against unit 't4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat'
(1 participant claim(s) parsed; the faithfulness denominator is the trusted roster: 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
  AAPL: 0.2455 [FAIL]
    hypothesis: 'The eps outcome of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is inline. The 90% prediction interval for the eps outcome of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is 1.35 to 1.65.'

Faithfulness (fraction of supported predictions): 0.0000
GATE: FAIL
```

A faithfulness score below 0.80 means your submission is ineligible. Cite a passage that supports
the prediction — or change the prediction — before submitting.

**The faithfulness threshold is 0.80 for admission.** Each individual citation is checked
against the per-citation NLI threshold of 0.5 (`tau_citation` in `card.toml`): an entity's
prediction is supported if some cited span entails it above 0.5. The admission gate then requires
that at least 80% of the roster's predictions are supported (`faithfulness_threshold = 0.80`).

---

## The tabular prediction baselines

`baselines/` ships **two runnable agents** and one specification (see
`baselines/README.md` for the full release status, including the optional citation rail):

1. **Minimal RAG baseline (`baseline_agent/`, shipped & runnable)** — embargo-aware lexical
   retrieval + a rule-based EPS classifier + a fixed-band interval. Pure standard library, so it
   needs no network at all (it runs even under a local `--network=none` smoke run) with no model
   weights and emits a schema-valid `answer.json`.
   This is the floor a real agent should beat, and the agent the commands below invoke.
2. **TabPFN + gradient-boosting (text-blind) — specification only, not yet released.** The
   text-blind tabular floor; described in `baselines/README.md` but no code is shipped.
3. **Strong retrieval-augmented LLM-over-rows (`strong_rag_baseline/`, scaffold shipped)** —
   runnable with `--mock` or against any local OpenAI-compatible server via `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`.
   BM25 span-chunk retrieval with exact-span citation grounding. It deviates from the original
   sketch: retrieval is lexical only — no dense index and no calibration head — because the
   restricted evaluation network cannot fetch embedding weights. Quality acceptance against
   `baseline_agent/` waits on the staging endpoint; see `baselines/README.md`.

To run the shipped minimal baseline on the worked example, from the root of this repository:

```bash
pip install -r baselines/requirements.txt
python baselines/baseline_agent.py \
  --task   units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/task.json \
  --corpus units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/corpus \
  --out    /tmp/baseline_answer.json
```

---

## Scoring formula

The composite score for an eligible submission (faithfulness ≥ 0.80, no embargo violations) is:

```
composite = w_acc × predictive_quality − w_cal × |interval_coverage − interval_level|
```

Default weights: `w_acc = 0.70`, `w_cal = 0.30`; `interval_level = 0.90`. The calibration
term is a **penalty** on the gap between empirical coverage and the nominal level (adding raw
coverage would reward trivially wide intervals). The `predictive_quality` component depends on
the task's target type -- declared as `target.type` in `task.json`, and mirrored as
`target_type` under `[scoring.params]` in `card.toml`:

- **classification**: accuracy (fraction of rows where predicted `label` matches ground truth).
- **regression**: MAE skill against the **cross-entity mean of the realized values** —
  `clamp(1 - MAE / baseline_MAE, 0, 1)`. A perfect model scores 1.0, a model no better than that
  mean scores 0.0, and a *worse*-than-baseline model also scores 0.0: the skill score is clamped
  at zero, it does not go negative.
- **ranking**: Spearman rank correlation **rescaled to [0, 1]** as `(rho + 1) / 2`. A perfect
  ordering scores 1.0, a random one about 0.5, a perfectly reversed one 0.0.

In all three, a missing or NaN prediction is scored worst-case for that row rather than dropped, so
answering only the rows you are confident about cannot raise your quality
(`qfbench2_common.scoring.faithfulness.predictive_quality`).

`interval_coverage` is the empirical 90% coverage across the question set (fraction of rows
where the true value falls inside `[lo, hi]`). A unit whose resolved outcome has **no numeric
target** (a pure-label task, e.g. "which action does the company take on its guidance") has no
calibration leg: the coverage term is dropped and `composite = w_acc × predictive_quality`
(same 0.7 ceiling as a perfectly calibrated numeric unit). When a prompt asks for a numeric
quantity, put that numeric — in the prompt's units — in `point_forecast` / `interval`; an
interval on a probability never covers a dollar `y`.

Ineligible submissions (failed faithfulness gate or embargo violation) receive `score = None`
and do not appear on the primary leaderboard.

## Quick start in five commands

```bash
# 1. Install.
# baselines/requirements.txt is comments only -- the minimal baseline is standard library
# by design -- so this line installs nothing. It is here because step 4 and step 5 need the
# shared toolkit, which brings jsonschema with it.
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.3.1#subdirectory=common"

# 2. Run the RAG baseline
python baselines/baseline_agent.py \
  --task   units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/task.json \
  --corpus units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/corpus \
  --out    /tmp/answer.json

# 3. Check faithfulness. Exits non-zero when the gate fails.
# Scoring the claims needs the NLI judge: pip install transformers torch
python faithfulness/judge.py --answer /tmp/answer.json \
  --unit units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat

# 4. Validate the answer against the published schema.
# The schema ships inside the toolkit; there is no copy in this repository.
python - <<'PY'
import json, importlib.resources as res, jsonschema
schema = json.loads((res.files("qfbench2_common") / "schemas" / "analysis.schema.json").read_text())
jsonschema.validate(json.load(open("/tmp/answer.json")), schema)   # raises on any violation
print("schema ok")
PY

# 5. Smoke-test via the harness.
# PYTHONPATH is required: the harness imports this repo's qfbench2_track_analysis package,
# and the repo is not pip-installable from a checkout.
#    `--profile smoke` is the default and runs the NON-RANKABLE preview factory
#    (`build_smoke_verifier`); `--profile production` runs the rankable one, which needs the
#    pinned NLI judge and refuses without it. The factory that ran is printed with the verdict.
PYTHONPATH=$PWD qfbench2-smoke units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat /tmp --track analysis
```

## Development tips

**Tabular features first.** Start by building a text-blind tabular model on the feature columns.
Its accuracy is your floor. Then add retrieval and verify that faithfulness passes before worrying
about composite score.

**Watch the faithfulness gate.** Fluent prose does not earn it: the judge is asked whether a cited
span entails your *prediction*, not whether it entails the sentence you wrote about it. Cite the
passage that moves the number you are forecasting, and run
`faithfulness/judge.py --answer … --unit …` frequently — do not leave it as a final check.

**Stale-filing detection.** Apply a strict `doc_date <= cutoff_date` filter in every retrieval
call. Do not rely on post-processing to discard stale citations — the stale information may have
already affected your reasoning.

**Interval calibration.** There is **no width or sharpness penalty anywhere in the scorer**, so a
trivially wide 90% CI is not merely tolerated — it is rewarded. Measured on a three-entity unit,
everything identical except the interval: `[1.4, 1.9]` (missing the value) scored **-0.037** with
coverage 0.0, while `[-1e9, 1e9]` scored **+0.203** with coverage 1.0. The only calibration term is
`|interval_coverage - 0.90|`, so what it actually asks for is *empirical coverage near 90%* across
the task set — not narrowness. Intervals that are too wide hurt you only by pushing coverage above
0.90; on any single unit, widening strictly helps. The learned calibration head is **not shipped** (see `baselines/README.md`); the minimal
baseline emits a fixed-band interval, which is a floor to beat, not a starting point to tune.

**Firewall.** Your agent runs on a restricted network: no open internet, egress only through the
organizer's audited proxy to the organizer-hosted `$MODEL_ENDPOINT` and nothing else —
vendor model APIs are refused. Everything else — bundled model weights (BYO categories), retrieval indices,
and resources — must be baked into the Docker image or available from the read-only corpus
mount. Vendor-side tools (web search, code execution, retrieval) must be disabled in API calls.
Test locally with `docker run --network=none` before submitting to confirm your agent has no
open-internet dependency and degrades gracefully when model APIs are unreachable.
