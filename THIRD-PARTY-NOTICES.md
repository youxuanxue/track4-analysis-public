# Third-Party Notices

This project incorporates or builds on the components below. **Each retains its own license**, and
that license governs that component — it is not superseded by this repository's `LICENSE` or
`DATA-LICENSE.md` (MIT). This file is a convenience summary; the authoritative license for any
released data file is the `license` field in its `manifest.json`.

## Software

- **ABIDES** (organizer-maintained fork) — **BSD-3-Clause**. Used by Track 3. The original ABIDES
  code remains under BSD-3-Clause and may be used commercially from upstream; **only the organizers'
  additions** (scenarios, regression harness, stylized-fact checker, throughput timer) are licensed
  under this repository's `LICENSE` (MIT).
- **Python dependencies** of `qfbench2-common` (NumPy, SciPy, jsonschema, pandas, PyArrow,
  transformers, PyTorch, and others) — each under its own license (BSD / Apache-2.0 / MIT / PSF).
  These are *installed*, not redistributed in this repository.
