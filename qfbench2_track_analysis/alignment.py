"""Exact entity-set equality and the numeric contract, both enforced before any metric runs.

The measured defect this module exists to remove: alignment iterated the **participant's**
``entity_predictions`` and did ``if outcome is None: continue``. Everything followed from that one
line. Answering one of three required entities scored ``0.67`` where the honest full-roster answer
scored ``0.203`` — a 3.3x gain for answering less — because the truth vector was rebuilt from
whatever the participant chose to answer. Duplicating an entity re-consumed the same truth row and
reweighted accuracy and coverage; an unknown entity was silently dropped.

The shared ``predictive_quality`` already enforces coverage against the truth vector it is handed.
That protection was a no-op because Track 4 handed it a truth vector derived from the submission.
This module fixes the input, not the shared math:

* alignment is driven by the **trusted roster**, in the trusted canonical order;
* the participant's entity set must be **exactly** the roster set — unique, complete, nothing extra;
* a missing, duplicated or unknown id fails before a metric is computed, so no aggregate is ever
  produced from a re-weighted denominator;
* NaN/Inf anywhere in a submitted number is a participant failure. Rows are **never dropped** to
  make a denominator smaller.

`target_type`, `interval_level` and the label vocabulary come from the trusted task/plan side. A
value read out of the mounted unit directory is only ever used to *cross-check* and never to
decide: the mounted card sits in the same tree the participant's container had.
