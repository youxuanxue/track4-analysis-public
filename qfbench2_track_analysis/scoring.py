"""Track 4 official scorer: one implementation, mandatory judge, fixed roster, no perfect defaults.

This module is the **single** Track-4 scoring implementation. The public official verifier, the
public smoke preview and the sealed private final scorer all reach the composite through
:func:`score_unit` here, so the three cannot drift the way three copies did — one that never built
a judge, one that fell back to a lexical stub on any exception, and one that had no schema gate at
all, disagreeing on cutoff polarity, target-type handling and interval validation.

What changed, and what each change closes:

* **The judge is mandatory in every rankable factory.** :func:`build_verifier` constructs the
  pinned production ensemble or raises an organizer fault. There is no ``ctx.get("judge")``, no
  skipped faithfulness block, and above all no ``ctx.get("_faithfulness", 1.0)`` — a missing judge
  used to mean *perfect* faithfulness. :func:`build_smoke_verifier` is a separately named factory
  that stamps ``judge_mode="smoke"`` and ``rankable=False``.
* **Evidence is bound to the prediction.** The entailment hypothesis is derived from the submitted
  label/forecast/rank/interval, not from participant-authored prose (see ``hypothesis.py``).
* **The roster is the denominator.** Alignment is driven by the trusted entity roster in trusted
  order; missing, duplicate and unknown ids fail before any metric runs (see ``alignment.py``).
* **Citations resolve through a trusted dictionary.** No participant string is ever interpolated
  into a path, and an unresolved, undated or post-cutoff citation fails closed (see ``corpus.py``).
* **An inadmissible unit scores W, not ``None``.** ``None`` is what removed a unit from the
  aggregate; the frozen policy is a pre-committed worst value that stays in the denominator, and
  real scores are clipped into the same domain so failing can never beat participating.
* **Public detail is enum code plus counts.** No raw exception strings; the previous gate returned
  ``{"reason": str(e)}`` and produced a ~1.5 KB detail embedding the whole answer schema.

Domain and worst case (frozen): ``desc``, domain ``[-0.27, 1.0]``,
``W = 0*w_a - w_c*interval_level = -0.27`` at the default weights.
