"""Adapt a C1 roster entry into the trusted roster and scoring parameters Track 4 scores with.

C1 1.1.0 grants Track 4 exactly what it asked for: ``expected_units[].entity_roster`` (ordered ids
plus count and digest) and ``expected_units[].scoring_params``. This module is the consumer side —
the one place a signed plan becomes an :class:`~qfbench2_track_analysis.alignment.EntityRoster` and
a :class:`~qfbench2_track_analysis.scoring.ScoringParams`, so no other module has to know the
plan's field names.

It fails closed on two places where the C1 *shape* used to be looser than Track 4's semantics. As
of C1 1.2.0 it is not: ``TARGET_TYPES`` and ``COMPOSITE_WEIGHT_KEYS`` are closed in the hub's
parser, and the golden fixture is re-minted onto real members of the enum. **The checks below
stay** — the hub validates a *document* at parse time, this validates an *entry*, and a caller
holding a :class:`~qfbench2_common.contracts.RosterEntry` from anywhere other than a freshly parsed
plan reaches only this one. ``scoring/tests/test_plan_contract.py`` asserts both layers refuse, so
neither can be removed on the strength of the other.

* ``scoring_params.target_type`` is a **closed three-value enum** (``classification | regression |
  ranking``), identical to the hub's. An unrecognized value is refused rather than defaulted,
  which is the whole point of T4-3: the pre-fix scorer fell back to label accuracy.
* ``scoring_params.composite_weights`` names exactly ``accuracy`` and ``calibration``, summing
  to 1, because ``W = -w_calibration * interval_level`` is the frozen worst case and a plan whose
  weights do not sum to 1 silently moves the domain the leaderboard is clipped into.
