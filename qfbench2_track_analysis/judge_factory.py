"""The production judge is mandatory, pinned, and fails closed. Smoke is a different function.

The measured defect: the official factory never constructed a judge at all. ``ctx.get("judge")``
was ``None`` under the real driver, the whole faithfulness block was skipped, and ``_score`` read
``ctx.get("_faithfulness", 1.0)`` — so **a missing judge defaulted faithfulness to perfect** and
every submission cleared the admissibility gate the track exists to enforce. A separate
implementation degraded to a token-overlap "lexical" judge on an environment variable, on a card
that happened not to list an ensemble, and on *any exception* while constructing the real one, each
with nothing but a log line.

This module makes the three states distinguishable and makes only one of them rankable:

* :func:`build_production_judge` — constructs the pinned ensemble or raises
  :class:`~qfbench2_track_analysis.codes.T4OrganizerFault`. Missing weights, an unloadable runtime,
  an unpinned revision, an unverified cache, or *no configured artifact at all* are organizer
  faults with **no participant score**, never a per-participant zero.
* :func:`build_smoke_judge` — a separately named factory that always stamps
  ``judge_mode="smoke"`` and ``rankable=False``. It cannot be reached by mistake: nothing in the
  production path falls back to it, and no environment variable selects it.
* Everything else — an exception.

**The model identity is an escalated legal decision (D6), so it is configuration, not code.** What
is frozen here is the *interface* and the *provenance fields*: model ids, a revision per model, a
tokenizer digest and a local cache tree digest, in exactly the shape the hub's C4
``JudgeRecord`` parses. The default is fail-closed: with no judge artifact configured, the
production factory refuses. That converts "legal has not answered yet" from a silent perfect score
into a recorded, blocking organizer fault.

Nothing here logs a prompt. Provenance is ids and digests; the premise and hypothesis strings that
travel to the judge are never written to any sink from this module.
