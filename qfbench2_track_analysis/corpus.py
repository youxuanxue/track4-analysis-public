"""Trusted corpus resolution: dictionary lookup, no-follow reads, one date policy.

A citation names a ``doc_id``. The scorer used to turn that string into a path —
``unit_dir / "corpus" / f"{doc_id}.json"`` — which made the participant the author of a filesystem
path inside the organizer's tree. A measured ``doc_id`` of ``../../secret_ref/oracle`` read a
sentinel planted outside the unit directory. This module replaces path interpolation with a
**dictionary built from the unit's trusted manifest**, so an unknown id resolves to nothing rather
than to somewhere else.

Four properties, each of which was absent before:

1. **Grammar.** A ``doc_id`` is one path component matching a strict character class. Separators,
   ``..``, absolute paths, encoded separators and NFC-denormalized forms are refused before any
   lookup happens, and refused again by the fact that lookup is a dict.
2. **Membership.** Only ids declared ``role: corpus`` in the unit manifest exist. A file that
   happens to sit in ``corpus/`` but is not declared is not resolvable.
3. **No-follow, digest-verified reads.** Documents are opened relative to a directory descriptor
   with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and must be regular files whose bytes match the manifest ``sha256``. A
   symlink at a declared name is an organizer fault, not a silent redirect.
4. **One date policy.** ``doc_date`` is an ISO-8601 *calendar* date, parsed to ``datetime.date``
   and compared as a date. The previous code compared raw strings and said so in a comment
   ("lexical == chronological"), which is true only for one exact spelling.

The embargo verdict **fails closed in every direction**: a citation that does not resolve, resolves
to a document with no ``doc_date``, or carries a malformed date is a participant failure. Before
this, an unresolvable citation was embargo-clean by construction, because the answer schema defines
no ``doc_date`` field for the fallback the shared helper reaches for.
