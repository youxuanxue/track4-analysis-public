    build_verifier(ctx)    -> HierarchicalVerifier     the OFFICIAL, rankable factory. It
                                                       constructs the pinned production NLI judge
                                                       or raises an organizer fault; there is no
                                                       judge-less path and no perfect default.
    build_smoke_verifier(ctx) -> HierarchicalVerifier  the separately named, always-non-rankable
                                                       local preview factory.
    score_unit(ctx, ...)   -> UnitOutcome              the single scoring implementation every
                                                       Track-4 entrypoint (public verifier, smoke
                                                       preview, sealed final scorer) goes through.

The driver passes exactly ``{unit_dir, output_dir, failure_map}``. Everything trusted — the card,
the task, the entity roster, the question cutoff, the digest-verified corpus index and the resolved
outcome when the phase supplies one — is hydrated from ``unit_dir`` and from any plan-derived
values the caller injects, which take precedence over the mounted tree.
