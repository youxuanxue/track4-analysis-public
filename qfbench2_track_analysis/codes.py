"""Track-4 reason codes, the two fault-domain exceptions, and the public projection.

Track 4 needs richer internal reasons than the twelve frozen public failure codes, and it needs
them **without** any of that richness reaching a participant. This module is the seam. A gate
raises :class:`T4ParticipantFailure` or :class:`T4OrganizerFault` carrying a :class:`T4Reason` and
a handful of integer counts; the reason drives the internal ``FailureLabel`` and the operator log,
and the only thing that crosses into participant-visible output is
``qfbench2_common.failure_labels.public_detail`` applied to ``{code, <counts>}`` — one of the twelve
frozen codes plus non-negative integers, never a string.

That is the fix for the measured defect where a single missing property produced a ~1.5 KB
``{"reason": str(e)}`` detail embedding the whole answer schema. Free text cannot be emitted from
here because no key in the public projection accepts text.

The two exception types are the hub's, subclassed rather than reinvented, so a caller that already
distinguishes ``ParticipantFailure`` from ``OrganizerFault`` keeps working:

* :class:`T4ParticipantFailure` — the submission is at fault. The unit stays in the C1 denominator
  and takes the plan's committed worst value ``W`` (``-0.27`` for analysis). It is never dropped.
* :class:`T4OrganizerFault` — organizer material or infrastructure is at fault. No participant
  score at all; at whole-evaluation scope the driver aborts rather than publishing a partial board.
