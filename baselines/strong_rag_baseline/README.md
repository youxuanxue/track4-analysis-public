# Strong RAG baseline — BM25 retrieval + house model over `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`

## Executive summary (read this first)

The track's reference retrieval-augmented agent (Baseline 3 in `../README.md`): for each entity
it retrieves the top-K span-level chunks from the frozen corpus with BM25 (embargo enforced at
retrieval time), sends them with the entity's tabular features to the house model at
`$MODEL_ENDPOINT`, and turns the model's quoted evidence into claims with **exact
`(doc_id, span_start, span_end)` citations** — model-supplied offsets are never trusted; quotes
are located as verbatim substrings of the corpus, and anything ungroundable is dropped rather
than cited loosely. One agent for all units, no per-unit tuning; deterministic given the model
pin and seed (temperature 0, fixed seed, stable tie-breaks).

**Status: scaffold.** Fully runnable end-to-end with `--mock` or any local OpenAI-compatible
server; quality acceptance (beats `baseline_agent/`, ≥0.80 faithfulness under the pinned judge)
waits on the staging `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`.

## Run

```bash
# standard interface contract
python -m baselines.strong_rag_baseline.cli \
  --task   units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/task.json \
  --corpus units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/corpus \
  --out    /tmp/answer.json

# wiring smoke run without any model server
python -m baselines.strong_rag_baseline.cli --task ... --corpus ... --out ... --mock
```

Environment:

| Var | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_ENDPOINT` | OpenAI-compatible base URL (harness-injected at scoring time) | — (required unless `--mock`) |
| `MODEL_NAME` | model id sent in the request — this is what the harness injects (see `SUBMISSION_CLI.md`, container environment contract) | empty |
| `MODEL_ID` | local-dev fallback for `MODEL_NAME`; read only when `MODEL_NAME` is unset | empty |
| `MODEL_TOKEN` | bearer token, if the endpoint needs one (local-dev convenience — not part of the published container contract) | none |
| `T4_SEED` | seed forwarded to the model | `20260731` |
| `T4_TOP_K` | retrieved chunks per entity | `10` |
| `T4_MODEL_TIMEOUT_S` / `T4_MODEL_RETRIES` | per-call timeout / retry count | `60` / `3` |

Local model example: `ollama serve` + `MODEL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1 MODEL_ID=qwen2.5:7b`.

## Design

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `indexer.py` | One chunk per corpus span; global offsets follow the scorer's join-with-space convention, so every chunk is citation-ready as-is |
| `retriever.py` | Pure-Python Okapi BM25; docs with missing or post-cutoff `doc_date` dropped before scoring; ties break by `(doc_id, span_start)` |
| `client.py` | stdlib HTTP client for `/chat/completions` (temp 0, seed, retries) + `MockModelClient` for tests |
| `prompts.py` | Per-target-type prompt; demands one JSON object with verbatim quotes |
| `span_finder.py` | Locates quotes as exact substrings (length-preserving curly-quote normalization); never trusts model offsets |
| `agent.py` | Orchestration; ungroundable quotes fall back to the source chunk's known-good offsets or are dropped; off-vocabulary labels and missing intervals get deterministic fallbacks |
| `formatter.py` | Final answer assembly + hard self-check (spans resolve, intervals complete, `notes` is an object) |

**BM25 only, no dense retrieval** (deviation from the Baseline-3 sketch in `../README.md`): the
eval sandbox's restricted network cannot fetch embedding weights at run time, so a lexical index
keeps the agent reproducible everywhere. The binding constraint is build-time vendoring: a dense
index is permitted if its weights are bundled in the image (`byo-small`/`byo-large` in
`SUBMISSION_CLI.md`), because nothing can be downloaded at run time. The chunking already
targets the corpus's natural citable units (rendered-table NOTES lines, per-span passages),
which recovers much of what dense retrieval would add on these corpora.

## Acceptance (tracked, not yet runnable)

- [ ] Schema PASS + embargo PASS on the public practice unit(s)
- [ ] ≥0.80 citation faithfulness under the pinned judge
- [ ] Predictive quality strictly above `baseline_agent/`
- [ ] Runs as-is on `sample-tasks/track4-analysis/` and passes `evaluation/check_submission.py`

All four wait on the staging `$MODEL_ENDPOINT` and the sample-tasks export.
