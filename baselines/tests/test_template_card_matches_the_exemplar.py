"""`templates/card.toml` must not become a second source of truth.

The authoring template was removed from this repository once because prose could agree with it
and still disagree with every card actually shipped. It is published again as an annotated
example — participants asked for the whole shape in one place — but only under a guard: the
scoring parameters, the compute grant and the agent budget it shows are pinned to the exemplar
unit's card, which is the card a participant actually receives.

Standard library only, so this runs in the secret-free ``firewall`` CI job.

Fail-closed (repo rule R3): if either file is missing, this test FAILS. It does not skip.
