"""Repo-local answer-material firewall, because the shared one exempts our whole split.

MEASURED 2026-08-28 against the installed toolkit, planting one file at a time at the root of
`units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/` and running `qfbench2 manifest assert-public-safe` on it:

    solution.py             -> rejected      outcome.json            -> ACCEPTED
    my_oracle.json          -> rejected      expected_labels.json    -> ACCEPTED
    answer_key_x.json       -> rejected      reference/x.json        -> ACCEPTED
    solution/x.json         -> rejected      adversarial_variants/   -> ACCEPTED
                                             adversarial_log.jsonl   -> ACCEPTED
                                             perturbation_log.jsonl  -> ACCEPTED
                                             solution_leak.py        -> ACCEPTED

Two independent reasons, both in `qfbench2_common.manifest.assert_public_safe`:

* Its rule 4 blocks answer-bearing material (`reference/`, `adversarial_variants/`, `outcome*.json`,
  `expected*`) only for units that are NOT `public-dev`. That exemption exists so a Track-1 practice
  unit can ship `checks/reference_data/` for self-grading. **Every published Track-4 unit is
  `public-dev`**, so for this repository the exemption switches the rule off entirely.
* Its oracle globs are `*oracle*`, `answer_key*`, `solve.sh`, `solution.py` — literal
  `solution.py`, so `solution_leak.py` matches nothing, and neither `adversarial_log.jsonl` nor
  `perturbation_log.jsonl` appears in any list.

AGENTS.md promises this repository rejects all of them. This test is what makes that true here.
Widening the shared toolkit's rules is a hub decision and is filed separately; until then a
track-local guard is the honest way to keep the promise the docs make.

Standard library only, so it runs in the secret-free ``firewall`` CI job alongside the stdlib half
of the unit validator — the half that still runs when the toolkit install fails.
