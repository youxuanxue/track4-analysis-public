"""Prose-vs-artifact drift guards (prevention PR from the 2026-08-27 sweep).

The sweep found 39 cases of prose hand-duplicating an authoritative artifact (schema, card,
code) and then drifting from it. These tests pin the four highest-traffic fact classes to
their artifacts so the next drift fails CI at authoring time instead of surviving to a
participant. Standard library only, so the whole file runs in the secret-free ``firewall``
CI job (which runs ``pytest baselines``).

Each guard says which past finding it would have caught, and carries the *exemplars* of that
finding class as executable controls: a guard that cannot demonstrate it catches its own class
is worse than no guard at all, because it gets cited as proof.

When one of these fails, the fix is almost never "edit the test": either the prose or the
artifact changed unilaterally — make them agree, or link the prose to the artifact instead of
restating it (the standing editorial rule in AGENTS.md).

Fail-closed rule (repo rule R3): every patrolled document must be present. If a file named in
:data:`DOC_FILES` is deleted or renamed, these guards FAIL — they do not quietly patrol a
smaller corpus and report green.
