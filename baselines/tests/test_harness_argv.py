"""The baseline must run under the EXACT argv the scoring harness issues.

`test_cli_exemplar.py` calls `run()` directly, which is why the shipped baseline could be
unrunnable without any test noticing: `run()` never sees argv, so it cannot see a CLI contract
mismatch. These tests go through `main()` — and through the real subprocess entry point the
Dockerfile's ENTRYPOINT uses — with the argv from SUBMISSION_CLI.md:

    docker run <image> analyze --task /input/task.json --corpus /input/corpus/ \
                               --out /output/answer.json

Two defects motivated them, both of which made the baseline exit 2 on every single unit:

1. the harness passed `--question /input/q.json`, a flag this CLI does not define naming a file
   no Track 4 unit contains (units ship `task.json`; `question.json` was a redirect stub and
   has since been removed entirely);
2. the CLI did not accept the leading `analyze` verb, which the harness passes as the container
   command — so even with the flag corrected, argparse rejected it as an unrecognized positional.
