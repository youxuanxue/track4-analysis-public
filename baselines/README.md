# Track 4 Baselines — Explainability

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 4 asks agents to predict a target per row in a table of entities — for example, whether
each company in a cross-section will beat its EPS estimate — grounded in a frozen evidence corpus.
This directory describes three reference baselines that span the performance spectrum from
text-blind to fully retrieval-grounded. **Beat the text-blind baselines** (TabPFN and gradient
boosting) to show that reading the evidence corpus adds value. **Beat the RAG baseline** to show
that better reasoning, retrieval, or calibration is possible. All baselines run inside a Docker
container on the restricted eval network: no open internet — the only egress is model-API
traffic through the organizer's audited proxy (declared vendor domains) or to the
organizer-hosted `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`. The shipped minimal baseline needs no network at all, so it
also runs under a local `--network=none` smoke run.

### Release status

| Baseline | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Minimal runnable RAG baseline (`baseline_agent/`) | **Shipped & runnable** — pure standard library, no model weights; produces a schema-valid `answer.json`. This is the agent the quick-start commands invoke. |
| TabPFN / gradient-boosting text-blind baselines | **Specification only — not yet released.** No code shipped; see the descriptions below for the intended design. |
| Strong RAG baseline (`strong_rag_baseline/`) | **Scaffold shipped — runnable with `--mock` or any local OpenAI-compatible server.** BM25 span-chunk retrieval + house model via `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`, exact-span citation grounding. Quality acceptance (beats `baseline_agent/`, ≥0.80 faithfulness under the pinned judge) waits on the staging endpoint; see its README. Deviation from the sketch below: lexical-only retrieval (no dense index, no calibration head yet) — the restricted eval network cannot fetch embedding weights. |
| Citation rail example (`guardrails_example/`) | **Shipped & runnable** — optional participant-side pre-submission checks (cited `doc_date <= cutoff`, well-formed spans) with an offline demo and illustrative NeMo Guardrails wiring. Advisory only; the organizer-side gates are the authority. Not a baseline agent — a rail you can bolt onto your own. |

The shipped minimal baseline trades predictive strength for zero dependencies: lexical retrieval
(no BM25/dense index), a rule-based EPS classifier (no LLM), and a fixed-band interval (no learned
calibration head). It exists to make the quick-start commands work end-to-end and to provide a
schema-valid reference output, not to be a competitive submission.

## Three baselines

### Baseline 1 — TabPFN (text-blind tabular, classification only)

**What it does.** TabPFN (Tabular Prior-Fitted Networks) reads only the numeric and categorical
feature columns from the entity table in `task.json`. It ignores the evidence corpus entirely.
It is a transformer pre-trained on thousands of synthetic tabular datasets and can make
predictions on small tables (a few hundred rows) without any task-specific training.

**Why it is here.** TabPFN is the state-of-the-art text-blind baseline for small cross-sections.
If your agent cannot outperform TabPFN on predictive quality, the evidence corpus and agentic
reasoning have added no value on tabular features alone.

**Limitation.** Text-blind agents cannot produce grounded citations. A text-blind submission
scores zero faithfulness and is ineligible (composite = None). TabPFN is listed to establish
the text-blind predictive floor, not as a submittable strategy.

Expected performance: classification accuracy ~0.45–0.55, faithfulness gate pass rate: 0%,
composite score: ineligible.

### Baseline 2 — Gradient Boosting (text-blind tabular, all target types)

**What it does.** XGBoost or LightGBM trained on the numeric and categorical feature columns.
This is the dominant classical method for tabular data in industry and competitions. Unlike
TabPFN, it supports classification, regression, and ranking targets natively.

**Why it is here.** Gradient boosting is the most competitive text-blind baseline for larger
cross-sections. It also provides a skill-score denominator for regression tasks (the
`baseline_MAE` used in the scorer's skill computation is derived from a gradient-boosting
prediction, not a naive mean, for fairer comparison).

Expected performance: classification accuracy ~0.48–0.58, faithfulness gate pass rate: 0%,
composite score: ineligible.

### Baseline 3 — Retrieval-Augmented LLM-over-Rows with Calibration Head (submittable)

**What it does.** For each entity row in the table, the agent:

1. Uses the `corpus_ref` pointer from the entity row to retrieve relevant passages from the
   frozen corpus using hybrid BM25 + dense retrieval (BAAI/bge-m3 or equivalent).
2. Passes the top-K retrieved passages plus the entity's tabular features to an LLM with a
   structured prompt. The LLM tier can be a bundled open-weights checkpoint (e.g.,
   Mistral-7B-Instruct, byo-small category) **or** an API call over the restricted network — the
   organizer-hosted `$MODEL_ENDPOINT` (OpenAI-compatible) or a declared vendor model API through
   the audited proxy (api category).
3. Generates a prediction (label or numeric estimate), a claim sentence, and a citation for each
   material statement.
4. A **calibration head** (a small quantile regression model) converts the LLM's raw confidence
   and retrieval strength into a calibrated 90% prediction interval.

This is the only baseline that can produce grounded citations and therefore the only one that can
be eligible for the composite score.

Expected performance: classification accuracy ~0.50–0.60, faithfulness gate pass rate ~65–75%,
composite score ~0.30–0.40.

## Interface contract

All three baselines implement the same `analyze` CLI:

```bash
analyze \
  --task   /input/task.json \
  --corpus /input/corpus \
  --out    /output/answer.json
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `--task` | file path | Path to the unit `task.json` (read-only) |
| `--corpus` | directory | Path to the frozen corpus directory containing `*.json` docs |
| `--out` | file path | Destination for the output `answer.json` |

Constraints:
- Restricted network is enforced during scoring: no open internet; egress only via the audited
  proxy to the organizer-hosted `$MODEL_ENDPOINT` only; vendor model APIs are refused. Local smoke
  runs without the eval network fall back to `--network=none`, so agents must degrade gracefully
  when model APIs are unreachable.
- The corpus directory is read-only at scoring time.
- Wall-clock budget: 10 minutes per unit. Exceeding this budget causes a timeout failure.
- Output must conform to `analysis.schema.json`.

## RAG baseline architecture

### 1. Corpus Indexer

Reads all `*.json` files from `corpus/`, extracts `span_index` arrays (character-level passages),
and builds a hybrid BM25 + dense dual-encoder index per entity row (using the `corpus_ref` field
to scope each entity's retrieval).

### 2. Retriever

For each entity row, retrieves the top-K (default K = 10) passages by hybrid score:

```
hybrid_score(span) = alpha * bm25_score(span) + (1 - alpha) * dense_score(span)
```

Default `alpha = 0.4`. Only spans from documents with `doc_date <= cutoff_date` are considered,
enforcing the embargo at retrieval time.

### 3. Reader / Reasoner

The top-K retrieved spans plus the entity's tabular features are assembled into a prompt:

```
[SYSTEM]
You are a financial analyst. Predict the target for each entity using only the evidence
provided. For each material claim, cite the exact document and character span.

[ENTITY]
entity_id: AAPL
sector: Information Technology
consensus_eps: 1.50
threshold_pct: 0.05

[EVIDENCE]
[1] EDGAR_0000320193_10Q_20240202 spans 295-627:
    "Services net sales were $23.1 billion..."
[2] ...

[TASK]
Predict: will AAPL beat, miss, or land inline with consensus EPS (threshold 5%)?

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
{"label": "beat|miss|inline", "point_forecast": <float>, "claims": [...]}
```

The LLM is called with `temperature=0.0` for determinism (pin temperature/seed where the API
supports it, and pin the model to a dated snapshot version). When run locally, a 4-bit quantised
checkpoint is used to fit within the memory budget; when run over the restricted network, the
same prompt goes to `$MODEL_ENDPOINT` or a declared vendor API through the audited proxy, with
vendor-side tools (web search, code execution, retrieval) disabled.

### 4. Calibration Head

A quantile regression model that converts the LLM's confidence and retrieval strength into a
calibrated 90% prediction interval:

**Inputs:**
- `llm_confidence`: softmax probability assigned to the predicted label.
- `retrieval_strength`: mean cosine similarity of the top-K retrieved spans.
- `tabular_uncertainty`: spread of predictions from the gradient-boosting ensemble.

**Output:** `lo`, `hi` — lower and upper bounds of the 90% prediction interval.

**Training:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import QuantileRegressor

qr_lo = QuantileRegressor(quantile=0.05, alpha=0.01).fit(X_train, y_train)
qr_hi = QuantileRegressor(quantile=0.95, alpha=0.01).fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Pre-trained weights would live at `baselines/weights/calibration_head.joblib` (specification only
— not shipped; the runnable minimal baseline uses a fixed-band interval instead of a learned head).

### 5. Output Formatter

Assembles `answer.json` with `entity_predictions` (one object per entity row), each containing
`label`, `point_forecast`, `interval`, and `claims`. Applies a second embargo filter: silently
drops any citation whose `doc_date > cutoff_date` before writing output. The filter runs before
the >=1-claim fallback, so a dropped citation is replaced with the newest embargo-eligible
document rather than leaving the entity schema-invalid.

The filter only catches citations it can date. A citation whose `doc_id` the agent cannot resolve,
or whose document carries no `doc_date`, passes through it — and since 2026-08-22 the scorer counts
both of those as embargo **violations**, which is ineligibility, not a score penalty. Surviving this
filter is not the same as being eligible.

## Faithfulness requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Non-empty citations | Every claim must include at least one citation with a `doc_id` that appears in `manifest.json`. |
| Valid span offsets | `span_start` and `span_end` must be non-negative integers; `text[span_start:span_end]` must resolve to a non-empty string. |
| Embargo compliance | Every cited `doc_date` must be `<= cutoff_date` from `task.json`. |
| NLI entailment | The NLI entailment score between the cited span text and the claim text must exceed `0.5` (`tau_citation`), evaluated offline by `EnsembleNLIJudge`; the submission is admissible when at least 80% of claims are supported (`faithfulness_threshold = 0.80`). |

---

## Recommended open-weights models

| Role | Model | Licence | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| Retrieval encoder | `BAAI/bge-m3` | MIT | 1.5 B params; supports dense, sparse, and multi-vector retrieval |
| Reader / Reasoner | `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` | Apache 2.0 | Strong instruction following; fits in 8 GB VRAM at 4-bit |
| Reader (alt) | `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` | Llama 3 Community | Slightly better on financial reasoning; requires licence acceptance |
| NLI judge (local) | `cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-large` | MIT | Use before submission to estimate faithfulness score offline |
| Tabular (text-blind) | `TabPFN` | MIT | Best for small cross-sections (< 1000 rows); classification only |

All locally run models must be baked into the Docker image. No HuggingFace Hub downloads are
possible at scoring time — hub domains are not on the restricted-network allowlist, and
`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` is set in the scoring environment. API-accessed models (via the audited
proxy or `$MODEL_ENDPOINT`) must instead be pinned to dated snapshot versions and disclosed —
with their training cutoffs — in the submission metadata.

## Submission checklist

Before submitting your Docker image, verify every item:

- [ ] **1. Docker image built and tested locally.**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my-t4-agent:latest .
  ```

- [ ] **2. `analyze` CLI works with the exemplar unit.**
  ```bash
  docker run --rm --network=none \
    -v $(pwd)/units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat:/input:ro \
    -v /tmp/t4-out:/output \
    my-t4-agent:latest \
    analyze --task /input/task.json --corpus /input/corpus --out /output/answer.json
  cat /tmp/t4-out/answer.json
  ```

- [ ] **3. Faithfulness pre-check passes.**
  ```bash
  python faithfulness/judge.py --answer /tmp/t4-out/answer.json \
    --unit units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat
  ```

- [ ] **4. All citations have `doc_date <= cutoff_date`.**
  ```bash
  python -c "
  import json
  t = json.load(open('units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/task.json'))
  a = json.load(open('/tmp/t4-out/answer.json'))
  cutoff = t['cutoff_date']
  corpus_dir = 'units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat/corpus'
  for ep in a.get('entity_predictions', []):
      for claim in ep.get('claims', []):
          doc = json.load(open(f'{corpus_dir}/{claim[\"doc_id\"]}.json'))
          assert doc['doc_date'] <= cutoff, f'Embargo violation: {claim[\"doc_id\"]}'
  print('Embargo check: OK')
  "
  ```

- [ ] **5. Evidence trace is non-empty and human-readable.**

- [ ] **6. Network behaviour verified.**
  Official scoring runs on the restricted eval network (audited-proxy egress to model APIs
  only; every connection logged). Verify your agent has no open-internet dependency and
  degrades gracefully when no network is present (the local smoke fallback):
  ```bash
  docker run --rm --network=none my-t4-agent:latest \
    python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('https://example.com')" \
    && echo "FAIL" || echo "PASS: no open-internet dependency"
  ```

## Evaluation metrics (recap)

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Predictive quality (classification) | 70% | Fraction of entity rows with correct `label`. |
| Predictive quality (regression) | 70% | Skill score = 1 - MAE / baseline_MAE, clamped to [0, 1]. |
| Predictive quality (ranking) | 70% | Spearman rank correlation rescaled to [0, 1]. |
| Calibration penalty | 30% | **Subtracted**, not added: `\|interval_coverage - interval_level\|`, where `interval_coverage` is the fraction of entity rows whose true value falls in [lo, hi]. Coverage is a target to hit, not a quantity to maximise. |
| Faithfulness (gate) | — | Fraction of the **entity roster** whose prediction is entailed by a span cited for it; must be >= 0.80 to be eligible. |

Composite = 0.7 × predictive_quality − 0.3 × |interval_coverage − interval_level| (interval_level
= 0.90). The calibration term is a coverage **penalty**, not a reward — adding raw coverage would
incentivise trivially wide intervals. Higher composite wins. Leaderboard sorted `desc`. Ineligible
submissions (failed faithfulness or embargo) receive `score = None`. Units whose resolved outcome
has no numeric target (pure-label tasks) have no calibration leg: the coverage term is dropped and
composite = 0.7 × predictive_quality.
