"""Synthetic Track-4 units for the public test suite. No real corpus, no real outcome, ever.

Every fixture here is generated from constants in this file: made-up tickers (``SYN-A``…),
made-up filings, made-up numbers. Nothing is copied from a private unit, and the public/private
firewall is the reason — a public test that needs a real corpus document is a public test that
publishes one.

The builder writes a complete unit tree (``card.toml``, ``task.json``, ``manifest.json`` with real
sha256 digests, ``corpus/*.json``, optionally ``reference/outcome.json``) so the tests exercise the
real trusted-manifest path rather than a hand-built dict that skips it.
