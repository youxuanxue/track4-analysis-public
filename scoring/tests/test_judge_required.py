"""T4-1: a rankable factory constructs a production judge, or there is no score.

The pre-fix behaviour, measured: under the driver's three-key context the official factory built no
judge, ``ctx.get("judge")`` was ``None``, the faithfulness block was skipped entirely, and
``_score`` read ``ctx.get("_faithfulness", 1.0)`` — a **missing judge defaulted faithfulness to
perfect** and an admissible ``0.67`` came back for a submission that cited a claim the corpus
contradicts. The regression below is the direct inverse: with no judge configured, the official
factory must refuse.

Positive control: the smoke factory builds, scores, and is visibly non-rankable — a gate that
rejects the legitimate case makes every rejection beside it uninterpretable.
