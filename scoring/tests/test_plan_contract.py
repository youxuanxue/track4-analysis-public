"""Contract tests against the hub's frozen C1 — the plan is the denominator and the parameters.

Three things are pinned here.

**The frozen numbers agree.** ``plan.failure_score_for(code)`` and ``plan.clip(score)`` are the two
functions the freeze says every track calls; this asserts Track 4's local ``DOMAIN_MIN`` and
``clip_to_domain`` produce exactly the same values, so there is no second opinion about ``W``.

**The shipped golden fixture is scoreable.** It used to carry ``target_type:
"point_and_interval"``, which is not a Track-4 target type, so the adapter refused it. C1 1.2.0
closes ``scoring_params.target_type`` to ``classification | regression | ranking`` and closes
``composite_weights`` to exactly ``accuracy`` + ``calibration`` summing to 1, and the fixture is
re-minted (unit 1 classification, unit 2 regression). The negative assertion that recorded the gap
is deleted; the positive one below replaces it.

**Both layers refuse a loose plan, and the test says so.** The refusal now lives in two places: the
hub's C1 parser rejects the document at construction, and Track 4's ``plan_adapter`` rejects the
entry at adaptation. They are not redundant — the adapter is what a caller reaches through when it
is handed a ``RosterEntry`` from anywhere other than a freshly parsed plan — so each negative
control below exercises **both**, and neither can be deleted on the strength of the other.
