"""Regression tests for ``g3_domain_semantics`` — the embargo and faithfulness checks.

These pin the *call conventions* into the shared toolkit rather than any model behaviour, so they
need no weights and no network. They exist because both halves of g3 were previously inert, each
for the same underlying reason: a predicate keyed on a field that appears in zero real answers.

1. **Faithfulness was identically 0.0.** The gate handed raw claim dicts to
   ``citation_faithfulness``, which iterates ``claim["citations"]``. In the multi-entity format a
   claim element bundles the text and its single citation in one flat object with no ``citations``
   key, so the inner loop never ran and every well-formed answer failed.
2. **Embargo was unconditionally empty.** ``embargo_violations`` was called without a corpus
   lookup, leaving the citation's own self-reported ``doc_date`` as the only source of truth — a
   field ``analysis.schema.json`` does not define.

Both are covered here against a real synthetic unit tree, so the trusted corpus index and the
prediction-bound hypothesis are exercised rather than mocked out. The legacy flat single-entity
answer shape, which the pre-fix scorer accepted through a fallback branch, is now refused: it
carries no ``entity_predictions`` and therefore cannot be aligned to a roster, which is the whole
mechanism that fixes the denominator.
