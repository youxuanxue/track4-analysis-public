"""Issue #22 ruling, pinned at VERDICT level (mirror of the sealed scorer's behaviour).

The ruling (2026-08-11, three-way rule 2026-08-22): every roster row numeric -> ordinary unit;
no row numeric -> pure-label unit with no calibration leg; mixed -> refused as an organizer
fault, as is a non-finite or non-numeric target. `test_pure_label_units.py` pins the same rule
at the `_true_vectors` helper level; this module pins what a participant actually receives from
`score_unit` — the composite, the nullable `interval_coverage`, and the fault propagation —
because the original defect was end-to-end: `_score` read ``float(out.get("y", 0.0) or 0.0)``
and scored every interval on a pure-label unit against an invented target of zero.
