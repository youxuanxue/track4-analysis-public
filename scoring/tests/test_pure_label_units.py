"""The issue #22 ruling: a unit whose outcome carries no numeric target has no calibration leg.

The sealed scorer has implemented this since 2026-08-11 (`final_scorer.py` types `interval_cov` as
`float | None` and says so at its module docstring). The public scorer did not, and the remediation
made it worse in two directions at once: a NULL target was silently coerced to `0.0` — so coverage
was measured against an invented number — while a non-numeric one raised an organizer fault, which
would have refused a unit anatomy the sealed side scores happily.

Three cases, and the middle one is the reason a single boolean will not do.
