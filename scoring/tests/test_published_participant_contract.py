"""What the published participant-facing artifacts promise, measured against the real scorer.

Three claims that shipped in `README.md` and `templates/answer.example.json` were wrong in the
same direction -- each described a soft penalty where the scorer actually returns the worst-case
`W = -0.27` for the whole submission -- and every one of them survived a mutation revert against
the full suite. They are pinned here by running `score_unit`, not by reading the prose:

* a `target_type` copied verbatim out of the answer template is `t4.target_type_mismatch` on every
  regression and ranking unit (`SCHEMA_INVALID_OUTPUT`), while an absent one is admitted and
  scored -- so the template ships without the field;
* a ranking unit is scored on `point_forecast`; `label` is never read, so "`label` carries the
  rank" cost a perfect ordering its entire score;
* a missing `interval` bound is `t4.schema_invalid` for the whole unit, not "zero coverage".

    RENAMED from `test_a_constant_point_forecast_ties_a_perfect_one`, which asserted the
    exploit rather than the contract. That test required a constant `point_forecast` to score
    predictive_quality 1.0 / composite 0.67 -- byte-identical to the honest answer -- and it
    passed, because the ranking metric broke ties by POSITION: every tie resolved to the
    roster's own order, so a submitter who expressed no opinion inherited the organizer's
    ordering and was graded on it as if it were a prediction. On this fixture the roster order
    happens to match the outcome, which is what turned "no information" into full marks.

    The shared ranking metric now ranks ties AS ties (average ranks), so a constant vector has
    no rank variance, Spearman's rho is 0.0, and the rescaling `(rho + 1) / 2` puts it at the
    NEUTRAL 0.5 -- neither rewarded nor punished for saying nothing. Measured on this fixture
    2026-08-29 against the shared toolkit:

        constant point_forecast -> predictive_quality 0.5, composite 0.32
        honest (true metric values) -> predictive_quality 1.0, composite 0.67

    Expressing no opinion stays ADMISSIBLE -- neutral is not a failure, and this test pins that
    too, so a later "fix" cannot quietly turn a flat answer into a DNF.

    THIS TEST GOES RED IF THE EXPLOIT REOPENS. Verified by execution, not by assertion: run
    against the pre-fix ranking code (position tie-breaking) the constant answer measures
    predictive_quality 1.0 / composite 0.67, and the two `pytest.approx` assertions below fail.

    Row-order independence is still pinned here: #28's `align_predictions` re-indexes against
    the roster, so serialisation order cannot move the score. An earlier draft asserted the
    opposite and failed, which is how the roster-ordering guarantee got pinned rather than
    assumed.
