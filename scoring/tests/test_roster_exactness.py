"""T4-3/A13: the trusted roster is the denominator, and answering less can never help.

The measured exploit, on the pre-fix scorer: a three-entity unit, one correct prediction available.
The honest full-roster answer scored ``0.2033``; answering only the entity it was sure of scored
``0.6700`` — **3.3x for answering less** — because alignment iterated the participant's rows and
skipped anything with no matching truth, so the truth vector was rebuilt from the submission.
Duplicates re-consumed the same truth row and reweighted the metric; unknown ids were dropped.

The regressions below reproduce all three and require each to be refused *before* a metric runs.
The positive control is the honest answer, which must still score, and must score exactly what it
scored before — the fix removes the exploit, it does not move the honest number.
