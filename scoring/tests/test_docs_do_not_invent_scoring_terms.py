"""No published document may promise a scoring term the scorer does not implement.

`docs/CONCEPTS.md` described a normalised **Winkler score** -- with a 20x miss penalty and a
baseline calibrated to 0.5 -- and told participants that sharpness "rewards narrow intervals".
None of it was ever implemented. `README.md` repeated the advice, so both files pushed
participants toward a strategy the scorer actually punishes.

Measured on a three-entity unit, everything identical except the interval:

    [1.4, 1.9]      -> score -0.037, coverage 0.0
    [-1e9, 1e9]     -> score +0.203, coverage 1.0

The entire calibration leg is `w_cal * |interval_coverage - interval_level|`, so on any single
unit widening strictly helps. Advice to narrow was not merely unenforced, it was backwards.

This test is deliberately keyed on the CODE, not on a hardcoded list of banned words: a term is
forbidden in the docs exactly when no Python file implements it. If someone later ships a real
Winkler term, this test goes green on its own rather than having to be remembered.
